# Using `kube-vip` in Hybrid Mode

We can deploy kube-vip in two different methods, which completely depends on your use-case and method for installing Kubernetes:

- Static Pods (hybrid)
- Daemonset (services only)

##Â Static Pods

Static pods are a Kubernetes pod that is ran by the `kubelet` on a single node, and is **not** managed by the Kubernetes cluster itself. This means that whilst the pod can appear within Kubernetes it can't make use of a variety of kubernetes functionality (such as the kubernetes token or `configMaps`). The static pod approach is primarily required for [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/), this is due to the sequence of actions performed by `kubeadm`. Ideally we want `kube-vip` to be part of the kubernetes cluster, for various bits of functionality we also need `kube-vip` to provide a HA virtual IP as part of the installation. 

The sequence of events for this to work follows:
1. Generate a `kube-vip` manifest in the static pods manifest folder
2. Run `kubeadm init`, this generates the manifests for the control plane and wait to connect to the VIP
3. The `kubelet` will parse and execute all manifest, including the `kube-vip` manifest
4. `kube-vip` starts and advertises our VIP
5. The `kubeadm init` finishes succesfully.

## Daemonset

Other Kubernetes distributions can bring up a Kubernetes cluster, without depending on a VIP (BUT they are configured to support one). A prime example of this would be k3s, that can be configured to start and also sign the certificates to allow incoming traffic to a virtual IP. Given we don't need the VIP to exist **before** the cluster, we can bring up the k3s node(s) and then add `kube-vip` as a daemonset for all control plane nodes.

# Deploying `kube-vip`

The simplest method for generating the Kubernetes manifests is with `kube-vip` itself.. The subcommand `manifest pod|daemonset` can be used to generate specific types of Kubernetes manifests for use in a cluster. These subcommands can be configured with additional flags to enable/disable BGP/ARP/LeaderElection and a host of other options.

Both Examples will use the same Architecture:

#### Infrastructure architecture

The infrastructure for our example HA Kubernetes cluster is as follows:

| Node           | Address    |
|----------------|------------|
| VIP            | 10.0.0.40 |
| controlPlane01 | 10.0.0.41 |
| controlPlane02 | 10.0.0.42 |
| controlPlane03 | 10.0.0.43 |
| worker01       | 10.0.0.44 |

All nodes are running Ubuntu 18.04, Docker CE and will use Kubernetes 1.19.0, we only have one worker as we're going to use our controlPlanes in "hybrid" mode.

## As a static Pod (for kubeadm)

The details for creating a static pod are available [here](./static/)

## As a daemonset

When using `kube-vip` as a daemonset the details are available [here](./daemonset/)
